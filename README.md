I am a Master's student at HMILab@PKU, supervised by Prof.Shanghang Zhang. My research focuses on 3D human modeling. I am particularly interested in the perception and synthesis of human motion and human-environment interactions, as well as driving digital humans and embodied intelligence through generated motion.
